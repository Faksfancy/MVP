Discover Delicious Combinations with Your Ingredients!

Team:
Akinseinde Ebenezer
Project Manager / Data Scientist
Extensive experience in project management (Agile methodologies) for efficient execution.
Expertise in data analysis and machine learning (crucial for the recommendation algorithm).
Fakolujo Michael
Lead Developer / UX/UI Designer
Proficient front-end developer with a deep understanding of web technologies (ensuring technical integrity).
Strong background in user experience and interface design (creating an intuitive and visually appealing UI).

Technologies:
Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS(SASS)
Frameworks: Node.js, Parcel, Barbel, SASS (for styling)
Libraries: Bootstrap
Platforms: Netlify (deployment)
Tools: GitHub (version control)
Resources: "Flask Web Development" by Miguel Grinberg, "JavaScript: The Definitive Guide" by David Flanagan, The complete JavaScript Course by jonas Schmedtmann

Technology Choices and Trade-offs:
Front-End Framework: We opted for a custom JavaScript solution with libraries like SASS for UI components, prioritizing flexibility and control over the user interface.
Hosting Platform: Netlify was chosen for its scalability, robustness, and wide range of services to handle high traffic and complex computations effectively.

Challenge:
Meal Magic tackles the issue of meal planning by suggesting exciting food combinations based on a single ingredient. It caters to users who struggle to find diverse and tasty recipes using existing ingredients.

Focus:
Discovering new combinations, not specific recipes or dietary needs.
Home cooks, food enthusiasts, and individuals seeking meal variety.
Global accessibility (usable by anyone with internet access).

Risks:
Technical:
Algorithm Accuracy: Mitigated by continuous testing and user feedback integration.
Scalability Issues: Addressed by leveraging AWS scalability features and load testing.
Non-Technical:
User Adoption: Encouraged by marketing strategies and user feedback-driven improvements.
Data Privacy: Secured by robust data protection measures and transparent privacy policies.

Infrastructure:
Branching Strategy: Using GitHub Flow with feature branches, code reviews, and automated testing before merging into the main branch.
Deployment: Netlify Elastic Beanstalk for easy scaling and management.
Data Population: Initial data will be a combination of curated and cleaned content from publicly available recipe databases and user contributions.
Similar Solutions:
Yummly: Suggests recipes based on ingredients (more focused on complete recipes and user preferences).
SuperCook: Allows users to input ingredients to find recipes (primarily focused on recipes, not combinations).

Meal Magic's Advantage:
There are over 1,000,000 recipes to search for.

This README provides a comprehensive overview of the Meal Magic project, outlining the team, technology stack, risk management strategies, and more. It sets the stage for a well-organized and innovative web application development process, focusing on a custom JavaScript solution for the front-end.
